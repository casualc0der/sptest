# SP Test

- Clone repo to local
- cd into ```sptest```
- Run ```ruby bin/logger path/to/file``` to parse the input
-- I have uploaded the sample file for ease of use, so you could just run
    ```ruby bin/logger webserver.log``` :)
- Tests are located in the spec directory (RSpec)
- I have tried to keep the code as clean as possible, however i am still pretty raw in terms of design and implementation (very open to any feedback!)

Thanks, Edd
